# Coffee_Roasting
so i built a basic neural network , which does a classification task 
the features are , coffee_amount in grams and coffee_temprature
the output is a threshold value , 1(yes, perfect coffee), (0, imperfect coffee)
layer_1 of the Neural network contains , 3 neurons , activation_function = 'sigmoid'
layer_2 of the NN contains 1 neuron that takes the output of the previous 3 neurons and activation_function  = 'sigmoid'
later, a threshold is applied in order to differentiate
